This project contains notebooks, data and Python files. All files work with the dike_model that is at the basis of this assignment. The goal is to analyse different policies that combine Room for the River projects, dike heightning and Early warning systems so as to give an advice to the municipality of Zutphen as to what combination of those factors would work best for protecting their city against flooding. 

Different problem formulations can be used, based on if the research is focust on a certain part of the river or the whole area. New problem formulations can be added. 

## Analysis with notebooks in order
- 1.Open exploration.ipynb
- 2.Robustnessipynb
- 3.Sensitivity.ipynb

The notebooks could be run in order, but the output data is also added to the data folder. Thus, the notebooks can also be run seperately.
